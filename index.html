        Every year new players from colleges across the country are drafted for the NFL. The team’s franchises come together and pick players from university teams across the country. But some universities have more players chosen than others. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This year — notable also because the first three picks were all quarterbacks — University of Alabama and Ohio State University both had the highest amount of players chosen from their teams. A majority of the players were also chosen from universities in southern states such as the Carolinas, Texas, Florida, along with midwest states like Missouri and Iowa. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The site Pro Football Reference <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/draft.htm"> charts details</a> of the players chosen for the 2021 draft including their university, the team that chose them, their position and age. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Trevor Lawerence, a 21-year-old quarterback from Clemson University in South Carolina, was the first player drafted this season. The Jacksonville Jaguars picked him, though the team overall has not been doing well this season, on the heels of a bad season in 2020 and no super bowl appearances in their history. 
      </p> 

      <p>
        Another quarterback, picked 15th by the New England Patriots, is Mac Jones. He’s a 23-year-old coming from University of Ohio who has received a lot of positive press and attention for his contributions so far this season.
